/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Principle 1: Window/Global Object Binding: If you are in the global scope the value of this will refer to the window or console Object.

* 2. Principle 2: Implicit Binding: Whatever is directly left of the invocation is the keyword context.

* 3. Principle 3: Explicit Binding: When we use .call(), .apply(), or.bind() methods, we are explicitly defining this.

* 4. Principle 4: New Binding:  Whenever we use a Constructor Function we use the new keyword and this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constuctor function.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
